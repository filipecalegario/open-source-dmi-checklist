# Checklist

The checklist consists of a set of questions based on each step of the DMI development process and the previously discussed challenges, especially inspired by the OSHWA certification checklist:

## General Aspects
* Is there a structured and organized website concentrating all the documentation and information about the project?
* Is there an open communication channel with the developers or makers to ask questions during the making process? (e.g., forum, e-mail)
* Is there a clear overview architecture diagram with the description of each part's details?
* Is there a description of the expected skills and resources required to realize the project?
* Does the documentation highlight critical, uncertain, difficult, or potentially confusing parts of the process of realization?

## Hardware (Mechanical Structure and Electronics)
* Is the hardware made out of an accessible consumer product? (e.g., Bela, LEGO, Arduino, hardware synthesizers)
* Are the original design files for the instrument's structure and electronic circuits publicly available (e.g., CAD files, schematics, technical diagrams)?
* Is the bill of materials publicly available and accessible? (e.g., links, prices, detailed descriptions) 
* Are there any instructions and explanations about the process of making the instrument's physical structure and electronic circuits publicly available? (e.g., wiki, Instructables, tutorials, images or videos about the process)
* Is there a source code version control publicly available for all the hardware and the mechanical structure? (e.g., git or SVN repositories)
* Are there photos at various stages of assembly publicly available?
* Are the design files licensed in a way that others may reproduce or build upon them? (e.g., Creative Commons)
* Is the construction and hardware design under an open-source license (e.g., CERN, TAPR, Solder Pad) so others may reproduce or build upon it?

## Software
* Is the software/firmware publicly available and with an open-source license?
* Is there a source code version control publicly available for the software? (e.g., git or SVN repositories)
* Does the instrument rely on an easily accessible proprietary software? (e.g., Max/MSP, Ableton Live, VST Plugins) 
* Are the support and configuration files publicly available? (e.g., mappings, software configuration diagrams, audio samples, presets, DAW project files)
* Are the presets, files, and projects licensed in a publicly available license (e.g., copyrighted audio samples)?
* Does the instrument use a standard communication protocol? (e.g., MIDI, OSC or Libmapper)
